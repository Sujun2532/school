  <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already,and I passed through some interseting places on the  way: Walla Walla,WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.</p>
  <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
  <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars,When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

  <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone,iPod, digital camera,and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</p>
